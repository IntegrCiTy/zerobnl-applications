It is the one from the beginning with no double condenser

It is the one most similar to Nader's plant and it is connected to the python version of dyesopt which is located in this folder.
The boiler is broken down in its 3 components but it does not work as I wish.
In particular, I do not manage to get the correct supply temperature to the HPT. This is due to the fact that the efficiencies os the 
3 components are quite low, as they are estimated in the python code.
My guess is that there should be an iterative calculation to size this component.
Since I do not have time for this now, I leave it for later. The alternative is to have just a balance node.

I consider it validated as for the design pdf from Nader, corresponding to 85MW_535C_125bar
