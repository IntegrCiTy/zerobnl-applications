   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (1) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=STOCKHOLM (ARLANDA)
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=STOCKHOLM_ ARLANDA - SWE IWEC Data WMO#=024600
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[59.65] degrees, Longitude difference=[17.95] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[1.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[6100.00] percent, [61.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Calculated Pump Efficiency=44.28% which is less than 50%, for pump=PUMP 1
   **   ~~~   ** Calculated Pump_Efficiency % =Total_Efficiency % [39.9] / Motor_Efficiency % [90.0]
   **   ~~~   ** Total_Efficiency % =(Rated_Volume_Flow_Rate [5.0E-003] * Rated_Pump_Head [179352.0] / Rated_Power_Use [2250.0]) * 100.
