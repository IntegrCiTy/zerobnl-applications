# DemoDeployICT
*Demonstration of the ictdeploy Python package for multi-energy systems co-simulation*

This project provide multiple examples demontrating the use of the [ictdeploy](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/ictdeploy) package.

## Getting Started

The co-simulation examples as well as the creation of the models are done with [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

You can find more about the Jupyter installation [here](http://jupyter.org/install).

Once Jupyter is installed, you need to install [ictdeploy](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/ictdeploy) and its requirements following the steps described in the README based on your operating system in the same Python environment where you installed Jupyter.

The Docker image for the different model's containers can be found [here](https://cloud.docker.com/swarm/integrcity/repository/list) and associated Dockerfiles [here](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/ictdockerfiles)
